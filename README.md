## <a id="description-header"></a> Description

As a means of learning about APIs, a weather dashboard was created! After fetching the information through JavaScript, the API's response was drilled down to obtain the relevant data and then shown to the user through a dynamically updated HTML.

The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard, wherein a user can obtain the most up-to-date information on the weather for any particular city in the US.
